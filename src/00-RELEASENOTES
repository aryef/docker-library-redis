=========================================

============================================================
8.0-M02 (v7.9.225)    Committed Mon 28 Oct 2024 14:00:00 IST
============================================================

This is the second Milestone of Redis Community Edition 8.0.

Milestones are non-feature-complete pre-releases. Pre-releases are not suitable for production use.
Once we reach feature-completeness we will release RC1.

### Headlines:

8.0-M02 introduces significant performance improvements. Both Alpine and Debian Docker images are now available on [Docker Hub](https://hub.docker.com/_/redis). Additional distributions will be introduced in upcoming pre-releases.

### Supported upgrade paths (by replication or persistence) to 8.0-M02

- From previous Redis versions, without modules

The following upgrade paths (by replication or persistence) to 8.0-M02 are not yet tested and will be introduced in upcoming pre-releases:
- From previous Redis versions with modules (RediSearch, RedisJSON, RedisTimeSeries, RedisBloom)
- From Redis Stack 7.2 or 7.4

### Security fixes

- (CVE-2024-31449) Lua library commands may lead to stack overflow and potential RCE.
- (CVE-2024-31227) Potential Denial-of-service due to malformed ACL selectors.
- (CVE-2024-31228) Potential Denial-of-service due to unbounded pattern matching.

### Bug fixes

- #13539 Hash: Fix key ref for a hash that no longer has fields with expiration on `RENAME`/`MOVE`/`SWAPDB`/`RESTORE`
- #13512 Fix `TOUCH` command from a script in no-touch mode
- #13468 Cluster: Fix cluster node config corruption caused by mixing shard-id and non-shard-id versions
- #13608 Cluster: Fix `GET #` option in `SORT` command

### Modules API

- #13526 Extend `RedisModule_OpenKey` to read also expired keys and subkeys

### Performance and resource utilization improvements

- #13531 Optimize `HSCAN`/`ZSCAN` command in case of listpack encoding
- #13520 Optimize commands that heavily rely on bulk/mbulk replies (example of `LRANGE`)
- #13566 Optimize `ZUNION[STORE]` by avoiding redundant temporary dict usage
- #13567 Optimize `SUNION`/`SDIFF` commands by avoiding redundant temporary dict usage
- #11533 Avoid redundant `lpGet` to boost `quicklistCompare`
- #13412 Reduce redundant call of `prepareClientToWrite` when call `addReply*` continuously

===========================================================

This is the first Milestone of Redis Community Edition 8.0.

Milestones are non-feature-complete pre-releases. Pre-releases are not suitable for production use.
Once we reach feature-completeness we will release RC1.

### Headlines:

Redis 8.0 introduces new data structures: JSON, time series, and 5 probabilistic data structures (previously available as separate Redis modules) and incorporates the enhanced Redis Query Enginer (with vector search).

8.0-M01 is available as a Docker image and can be downloaded from [Docker Hub](https://hub.docker.com/_/redis). Additional distributions will be introduced in upcoming pre-releases.

### Supported upgrade paths (by replication or persistence) to 8.0-M01


- From previous Redis versions, without modules

The following upgrade paths (by replication or persistence) to 8.0-M01 are not yet tested and will be introduced in upcoming pre-releases:
- From previous Redis versions with modules (RediSearch, RedisJSON, RedisTimeSeries, RedisBloom)
- From Redis Stack 7.2 or 7.4

### New Features in binary distributions

- 7 new data structures: JSON, Time series, Bloom filter, Cuckoo filter, Count-min sketch, Top-k, t-digest
- The enhanced Redis Query Engine (with vector search)

### Potentially breaking changes

- #12272 `GETRANGE` returns an empty bulk when the negative end index is out of range
- #12395 Optimize `SCAN` command when matching data type

### Bug fixes

- #13510 Fix `RM_RdbLoad` to enable AOF after RDB loading is completed
- #13489 `ACL CAT` - return module commands
- #13476 Fix a race condition in the `cache_memory` of `functionsLibCtx`
- #13473 Fix incorrect lag due to trimming stream via `XTRIM` command
- #13338 Fix incorrect lag field in `XINFO` when tombstone is after the `last_id` of the consume group
- #13470 On `HDEL` of last field - update the global hash field expiration data structure
- #13465 Cluster: Pass extensions to node if extension processing is handled by it
- #13443 Cluster: Ensure validity of myself when loading cluster config
- #13422 Cluster: Fix `CLUSTER SHARDS` command returns empty array

### Modules API

- #13509 New API calls: `RM_DefragAllocRaw`, `RM_DefragFreeRaw`, and `RM_RegisterDefragCallbacks` - defrag API to allocate and free raw memory

### Performance and resource utilization improvements

- #13503 Avoid overhead of comparison function pointer calls in listpack `lpFind`
- #13505 Optimize `STRING` datatype write commands
- #13499 Optimize `SMEMBERS` command
- #13494 Optimize `GEO*` commands reply
- #13490 Optimize `HELLO` command
- #13488 Optimize client query buffer
- #12395 Optimize `SCAN` command when matching data type
- #13529 Optimize `LREM`, `LPOS`, `LINSERT`, and `LINDEX` commands
- #13516 Optimize `LRANGE` and other commands that perform several writes to client buffers per call
- #13431 Avoid `used_memory` contention when updating from multiple threads

### Other general improvements
